DNF tracer Plugin
=================

Plugin
------

Calls `tracer <http://tracer-package.com/>`_ after every successful transaction. It finds running applications which are outdated by transaction's packages.

There you can see DNF output with ``dnf-plugins-extras-tracer`` installed:

::

    $[FrostyX  ~]-> sudo dnf update vim-X11
    ...
    Running transaction
      Upgrading    : vim-common-2:7.4.179-1.fc20.i686                           1/6
      Upgrading    : vim-X11-2:7.4.179-1.fc20.i686                              2/6
      Upgrading    : vim-enhanced-2:7.4.179-1.fc20.i686                         3/6
      ...

    Upgraded:
      vim-X11.i686 2:7.4.179-1.fc20           vim-common.i686 2:7.4.179-1.fc20
      vim-enhanced.i686 2:7.4.179-1.fc20

    You should restart:
      gvim

    Done!

It is a good idea to restart those applications, because they can be potentially dangerous. They can contain old security issues, which are fixed in new version.
